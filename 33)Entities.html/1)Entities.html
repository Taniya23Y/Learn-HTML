    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    <p>Some characters are reserved in HTML.</p>
    <p>If you use the less than (&lt;) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.</p>
    <p>Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.</p>
    <p> A character entity looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
        &entity_name;
        OR
        &#entity_number;
    </pre>
    <p>To display a less than sign (&lt;) we must write: &lt; or &#60;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantage of using an entity name: </strong>An entity name is easy to remember.</li>
        <li><strong>Disadvantage of using an entity name: </strong>Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-breaking Space</h2>
    <p>A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;</p>
    <p>A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.</p>
    <p>Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.</p>
    <ul>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <li>§ 10</li>
        <li>10 km/h</li>
        <li>10 PM</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating 
        spaces in HTML pages.</p>
    <p>If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real 
        spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The non-breaking hyphen (-) is used to define a hyphen 
        character &#8209; that does not break into a new line.</p>

        <h2>Combining Diacritical Marks</h2>
        <p>A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.</p>
        <p>Some diacritical marks, like grave ( ̀  )and acute ( ́  )are called accents.</p>
        <p>Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, 
            and between two letters.</p>
        <p>Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to
             produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used 
             in the page.
