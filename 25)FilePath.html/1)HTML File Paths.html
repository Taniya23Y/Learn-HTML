      <h1>HTML File path!</h1>
      <p>
        An HTML file path is used to describe the location of a file in a
        website folder. File paths are like an address of file for a web
        browser. We can link any external resource to add in our HTML file with
        the help of file paths such as images, file, CSS file, JS file, video,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The src or href attribute requires an attribute to link any external
        source to HTML file.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Following are the different types to specify file paths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. <strong>&lt;img src="picture.jpg"&gt; = </strong> It specifies that
          picture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. <strong>&lt;img src="picture.jpg"&gt; = </strong> It specifies that
          picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. <strong>&lt;img src="picture.jpg"&gt; = </strong> It specifies that
          picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the root of the current
          web.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. <strong>&lt;img src="picture.jpg"&gt; = </strong> It specifies that
          picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current
          folder.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        File paths are used on webpages to link external files like:
        <br />
        <li>Web pages</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Style sheets</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        There are two types of File Paths:
        <br />
        <li>Absolute File path</li>
        <li>Relative File path</li>
      </ol>
    </fieldset>
