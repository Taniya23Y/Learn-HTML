        <h1>HTML Page Title</h1>
        <p>
          Every web page should have a page title to describe the meaning of the
          page.
        </p>
        <p>The &lt;title&gt; element adds a title to your page:</p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <p>
          The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO).
          The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when
          listing pages in search results.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <h2>The &lt;title&gt; element:</h2>
                <li>defines a title in the browser toolbar</li>
                <li>provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites</li>
                <li>displays a title for the page in search engine-results</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!</p>
