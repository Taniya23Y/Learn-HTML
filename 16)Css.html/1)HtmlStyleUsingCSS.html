      <h1>HTML style using CSS</h1>
      <h3>
        CSS = Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a
        webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text,
        the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out,
        what background images or background colors are to be used, different
        displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
      </h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Tips:</strong>The word <strong>cascading</strong> means that a
        style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children
        elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to
        "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the
        body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!

      <h2>Using CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Inline - </strong>by using the style attribute inside HTML
          elements
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internal - </strong>by using a &lt;style&gt; element in the
          &lt;head&gt; section
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>External - </strong>by using a &lt;link&gt; element to link to
          an external CSS file
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,
        because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
