      <h1>HTML Favicon</h1>
      <p>
        A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the
        browser tab.
      </p>
      <strong>How To Add a Favicon in HTML</strong>
      <p>
        You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your
        own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tips:</strong>A favicon is a small image, so it should be a
        simple image with high contrast.
      </p>
      <p>
        A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the
        browser tab
      </p>
      <p>
        To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the
        root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root
        directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A
        common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, add a &lt;link&gt; element to your "index.html" file, after the
        &lt;title&gt; element, like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, save the "index.html" file and reload it in your browser. Your
        browser tab should now display your favicon image to the left of the
        page title.
