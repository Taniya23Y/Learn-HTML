      <p>
        <q>I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you
          are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new
          things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself,
          changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and
          more importantly, you're Doing Something. So that's my wish for you,
          and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New Mistakes. Make
          glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's ever made before.
          Don't freeze, don't stop, don't worry that it isn't good enough, or it
          isn't perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or
          life. Whatever it is you're scared of doing, Do it. Make your
          mistakes, next year and forever.</q>
