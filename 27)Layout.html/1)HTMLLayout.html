        <h2>Inroductiojn to HTML</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong>stands for
          <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong>, which is the most widely
          used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by
          Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
          specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major
          version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01
          version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version
          which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in
          2012.
          <br />
          <strong>Why to Learn HTML?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the
          structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth
          to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between
          researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with
          the help of different tags available in HTML language.
          <br />
          HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a
          great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web
          Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
          learning HTML</p>

        <h2>Sidebar information</h2>
        <p>this contains information which represent like a side for a webpage.A sidebar 
        is a small section of text next to a longer article. A sidebar usually has 
        information that relates to the main story beside it. Sidebar alert: it also means 
        changing the subject in the middle of a conversation.
        <br>
        Sidebars began in the printed newspaper world, and they've moved, along with 
        newspapers and other news sources, to the internet. Most professionally-designed web pages include sidebars. In the legal world, a sidebar has a completely different meaning—it's a courtroom conversation between lawyers and the judge that jury members can't hear. The newspaper meaning dates from the mid-20th century.</p>

        <h2>Histroy of Computer</h2>
        <p>When we study the many aspects of computing and computers, it is important to know about the history of computers. Charles Babbage designed an Analytical Engine which was a general computer It helps us understand the growth and progress of technology through the times. It is also an important topic for competitive and banking exams.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Early Computing Devices</strong> <br> People used sticks, stones, and bones as counting tools before computers were invented. More computing devices were produced as technology advanced and the human intellect improved over time. Let us look at a few of the early-age computing devices used by mankind.
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Abacus</strong> <br> Abacus was invented by the Chinese around 4000 years ago. It’s a wooden rack with metal rods with beads attached to them. The abacus operator moves the beads according to certain guidelines to complete arithmetic computations.</li>
            <li><strong>Napier’s Bone</strong> <br> John Napier devised Napier’s Bones, a manually operated calculating apparatus. For calculating, this instrument used 9 separate ivory strips (bones) marked with numerals to multiply and divide. It was also the first machine to calculate using the decimal point system.</li>
            <li><strong>Pascaline</strong> <br> Pascaline was invented in 1642 by Biaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher. It is thought to be the first mechanical and automated calculator. It was a wooden box with gears and wheels inside.</li>
            <li><strong>Stepped Reckoner or Leibniz wheel</strong> <br> In 1673, a German mathematician-philosopher named Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved on Pascal’s invention to create this apparatus. It was a digital mechanical calculator known as the stepped reckoner because it used fluted drums instead of gears.</li>
            <li><strong>Difference Engine</strong> <br> In the early 1820s, Charles Babbage created the Difference Engine. It was a mechanical computer that could do basic computations. It was a steam-powered calculating machine used to solve numerical tables such as logarithmic tables.</li>
